# Advent of Code 2024
This repo holds my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), an annual global coding competition every
December 1-25. Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that
can be solved in any programming language you like.

I've chosen Python for my solutions this year as it is the language I found easiest to jump back into programming with having not programmed in some time.
